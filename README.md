# Hypnos

Hypnos is a mobile app designed to help users track and improve their sleeping habits. Built with Flutter, it features a calming interface and supports:

- Sleep Tracking (manual input)
- Sleep Quality (rating & notes)
- Visualizations (weekly/monthly graphs)
- Reminders (bedtime reminders)
- Sleep Goals (set & track)
